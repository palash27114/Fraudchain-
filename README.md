# Fraudchain-
FraudChain++ is an end-to-end Anti-Money Laundering (AML) framework built on Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for detecting illicit activity in Bitcoin transaction networks. The project combines graph-based learning, explainable AI, and real-time streaming systems to enable regulator-aligned, production-ready fraud detection.
